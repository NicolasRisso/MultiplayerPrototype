## Observations

- If you can't locate the server through the matchmaking system, use the **Invite Friend** feature on Steam to connect with your friends.
- Please note that Steam ID 480 has regional restrictions which might limit the discovery of servers in other regions.

## Project Description

Multiplayer Prototype - Steam is an experimental project developed to test multiplayer integration using the Steam API. The primary goal is to explore replicated physics features and server authentication, creating a dynamic and interactive experience in a platform-based environment.

## Features

- **Moving Platforms:**  
  Platforms that can operate autonomously or be activated by triggers, providing dynamic challenges during gameplay.

- **Speed Changes (Running):**  
  A mechanism that allows players to increase their speed, which is authenticated by the server.

- **Object Interaction:**  
  Players can pick up and drop objects using realistic physics, opening up opportunities for puzzles and interactive environmental elements.

- **Button Activation (Triggers):**  
  Buttons that, when activated, interact with platforms â€” including changes to visual properties such as altering the color of platform materials.

- **Replication and Server Authentication:**  
  Implementation of replicated physics and server authentication systems ensures that all actions and interactions remain synchronized among players, promoting a stable and secure multiplayer experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** C++ and Blueprints (BP)  
  A hybrid implementation that leverages the power and flexibility of C++ along with the ease of prototyping provided by Blueprints.

- **Game Engine:** Unreal Engine  
  The engine used for developing and running the project, which offers robust support for multiplayer functionality and advanced physics.

- **Multiplayer Integration:** Steam API  
  Handles authentication, client communication, and the management of multiplayer sessions.

## Purpose and Objectives

- **Multiplayer Integration Testing:**  
  Validate the effectiveness of the Steam API in a real-world game environment, ensuring secure and stable communication among players.

- **Exploration of Replicated Physics:**  
  Develop and test mechanics involving replicated realistic physics, ensuring that all clients experience consistent interactions, especially with platforms and interactive objects.

- **Learning and Prototyping:**  
  Provide a practical foundation for developers to explore and learn from the combination of C++ and Blueprints, taking advantage of the strengths of both development methods.
